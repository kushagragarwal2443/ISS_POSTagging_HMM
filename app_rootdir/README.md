Welcome,
This repository is part of submission of ISS assignment 4.
This assignment is related to topics such as web development in back-end and also its merger with front end.
We have used mainly two python modules namely : 1. Flask 2. SQLite.
To run the web app;
1.Go to terminal.
2.Run the following command :
python3 app.py
3.If there are any problems, then first install all the requirements by running following command:
./requirements.sh
The terminal would direct you to a link which would load the introduction page for the experiment POS-Tagging using Hidden Markov Model, from the virtual lab repository of IIIT-Hyderabad.

The experiment would ask you to select a corpus a,b or c. Having done this, you will be asked to fill an emission and transition matrix on the basis of a sentence given. Once you have entered your answers you will be told how many of your values were correct and how many werent.
You will then be asked if you want to view the answers for the same.
The answers for the correct emission and transition matrices for the given corpus will be displayed.
The Quiz-
There are 4 subjective questions in the quiz section that require non-empty field answers.
Once you have submitted the answers you will have the choice to see all the answers for these question that have been entered till now.
